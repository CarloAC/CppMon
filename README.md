# CppMon
Pokémon-like combat system [An old project wroten in C++]

The main idea is to realize a system which can simulate the old pokémon game combat system.
It should start a match between 2 different players; each of them is able to choose their own monster from an assigned team.
Every monster is able to perform 'till 4 different types of attack, and can be changed with another monster during the fight.
Every attack may have a specific modificators and take into account the type of the monster is facing, in order to take advantage of the weakness of that monster.
